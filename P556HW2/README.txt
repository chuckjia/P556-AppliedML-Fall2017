The folder contains all the files needed to run the R code.

General Guide:

  - To view the core codes in R, use the R files in the folder “Rfiles”. The code
    files are organized by problems.

  - To run the R code, go to the folder “OriginalFiles” and follow the instructions
    below. This folder has the same files as the folder “Rfiles” but not organized
    for purpose of file dependencies.


~/OriginalFiles/

  Due to dependency issues, the best way to run the R codes is to directly use 
  files in this folder. To run any code, first assign the parent folder path to 
  the variable “FolderPath”.

  - To run the tasks in Problem 3, use the file “Prob3-Commands.R”. 
    Configurations and instructions are included.

  - To run the tasks in Problem 4, use the following files:
      “Prob4-1to3.R”, “Prob4-4.R”, and “Prob4-4-Plots.R”
    Configurations and instructions are included.

  - To run the tasks in Problem 5, use the file “Prob5.R”. Configurations and
    instructions are included.

  - To run the tasks in Problem Extra Credit 1, use the files
      “ProbEC1-Commands.R” and “ProbEC1-Plots.R”
    Configurations and instructions are included.

  - To run the tasks in Problem Extra Credit 2, use the files 
    “ProbEC2-Commands.R”. Configurations and instructions are included.


~/P556HW2 Chuck Jia.pdf

  - This file is the solution to this homework assignment.


~/Rfiles/

  - In this folder, the R codes are separated into folders and files. Due to 
    dependencies between files, many files cannot be merged into 1 file.

  - The files “Gk3.1.R” and “Gk3.2.R” contain the EM algorithm from the two
    problems respectively.



~/TexFiles/

  - This folder contains the .tex files needed to compile the .pdf homework 
    solutions.
