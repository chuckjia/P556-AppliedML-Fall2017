The folder contains all the files needed to run the R code.

General Guide:

  - To view the core codes in R, use the R files in the folder “CoreRCodes”.

  - To run the R code, go to the folder “Rcodes” and follow the instructions
    below.


~/RCodes/

  Due to dependency issues, the best way to run the R codes is to directly use 
  files in this folder. To run any code, first reassign working directory.

  - To run the tasks in any problem, run commands in the corresponding R file.
    The file names are corresponding to the problem number. 
    Configurations and instructions are included.
