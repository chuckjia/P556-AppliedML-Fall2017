~/RFiles/

This folder contains all the R code for this homework assignment

- Prob1.R includes all the calculation and plotting code for Problem 1.

- Prob4-ReadData.R includes the code for reading data from data sets 
  (in Problem 4)

- Prob4-kmeans.R includes the (Lloyd) k-means algorithm. To run it, 
  first run the Prob4-ReadData.R file (need to select the dataset). Then 
  set values for kRange (the k values) run Prob4-kmeans.R.

- Prob4-Plot.R includes the code for plotting the result (total error 
  rates). To plot, run Prob4-kmeans.R first to generate result.

- Prob5.R has two parts. The first one is only about using the built-in 
  k-means functions, while the second one is using the Elbow Method.

- ProbEC1.R contains R code to pre-process data from the Breast Cancer 
  Wisconsin Data Set.

- ProbEC2-kmeans.R includes the R code for k-means with the new stopping 
  criterion. Settings are the same as in Prob4-kmeans.R.

- ProbEC2-Plot.R includes the R code for plotting the SSE. To plot, run 
  ProbEC2-kmeans.R first to generate the result.

- ProbEC3 includes the code for the k-means++ algorithm. Settings are 
  the same as in Prob4-kmeans.R.
